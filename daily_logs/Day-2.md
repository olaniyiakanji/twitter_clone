# Day 2

# Narration
On the second day of the project, I encountered various challenges while making significant progress in several crucial areas of the Twitter Clone project.

# Breakdown
##  Architectural Setup
1. **Architectural Patterns**: Explored and defined the architectural patterns for the project to ensure a well-organized codebase, making it easier to manage and scale as the project evolves.

## User Interface (UI) Development
2. **Login and Signup UI**: Created visually appealing and user-friendly login and signup UI components, setting the foundation for a seamless user experience. Namely the `LoginView` and the `SignUpView` components of the app.

##  Authentication
3. **User Signup**: Implemented user signup using Appwrite Auth. While this significantly enhanced the app's security, configuring and fine-tuning the authentication process posed some initial challenges. I faced quite a number of challenges with this as I was new to Appwrite's systems. I had to create test user accounts to verify sign up was really working.

## Dependency Injection
4. **Dependency Management**: Established class and dependency injection, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the codebase. However, ensuring smooth integration and testing of these dependencies required careful consideration.

# Challenges
- **Authentication Configuration**: Configuring Appwrite Auth for user signup, while crucial for security, required a deeper understanding of authentication mechanisms and some troubleshooting.
- **Dependency Integration**: Integrating dependency injection, although beneficial in the long run, demanded attention to detail and testing to ensure it worked seamlessly within the project's context.
